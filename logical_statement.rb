  # Logical Statements are guaranteed to return boolean
  # either :and or :or, which may be written as && and ||
  #
  # Also they guarantee that the right expression does not get evaluated
  # if the whole expression fails on the left expression.
  # ie: false && non_existant_method
  # will never call the non_existant_method , but instead evaluate to false
  #
  # Sol has no concept of this, so the Statement is expanded into the if
  # that it really is
